\section*{Problem 1}
	\begin{proof} [Solution]
		We finally use fine dust distribution data. First, we design a 2D CA simulator and then compare its results with distributed data. We confirmed that this data is provided as public data by many institutions both domestically and overseas. But 2D CA implementation requires a lot of other data.\\
		First of all, we need wind data. So, we extract the wind direction and speed as data from a site that provides real-time wind direction around the world. Of course, this data must be refined and used for our purposes.\\
		We will also utilize factory distribution data. From public data from domestic government agencies, the distribution of industrial complexes across the country is applied to the map. Factories may generate fine dust periodically. Since it is difficult to consider all factories, the distribution of factories in the map and region used is calculated and applied proportionally.\\
		Additionally, population numbers, environmental protection areas, mountain ranges, and river distribution can be considered. We plan to consider this data after first completing a prototype simulator and then comparing it with actual fine dust data to find insights.\\
