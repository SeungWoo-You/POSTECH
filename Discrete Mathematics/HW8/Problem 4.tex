\section*{Problem 4}
	\begin{proof} [Solution]
		Skipped. Just check the followings if not isomorphic.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Degree. All degrees of vertices should be conserved.
			\item Connection. All connection(weight of edges, degree of vertices, or else) are the same.
			\item Cycle. All cycles are preserved.
		\end{itemize}
		If you claim the isomorphism, then use the following form:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item [] Let $f: G\rightarrow H$ be a graph mapping with $f(a) = 1, f(b) = 2, \cdots$(The alphabet is the node of $G$, and the number is the node of $H$. Lists ways to correspond nodes in $G$ to nodes in $H$). Then $G\simeq H$ under $f$.
		\end{itemize}
