\section{Conclusion}
    Based on the large difference between the simulation and the actual results, we can conclude that the impact of the factories on fine dust is rare unlike our hypothesis.

    Looking at the actual data, we believe that if we had observed the existing map more closely, we could have gained additional insights in addition to the one above before implementing the simulation. Considering international impact seems to have been a better option.
    
    It was our mistake to not observe the data enough before deciding how the simulation should work.
