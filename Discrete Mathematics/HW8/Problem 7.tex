\section*{Problem 7}
	\begin{proof}
		If Peterson Graph $G$ is a planar, then it should satisfies the above problem because $G$ has no cycle with length $\leq 4$. $G$ has $v = 10$ and $e = 15$. This gives $f = 2 - v + e = 7$ if $G$ is a planar. However, from the above problem, we get $2e \geq 5f$, contradiction. Therefore, $G$ is not planar.\\
