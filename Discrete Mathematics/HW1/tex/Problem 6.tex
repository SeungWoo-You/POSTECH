\section*{Problem 6}
\begin{proof}
	Proof by induction. Consider $s = 1$. i.e. $m = 1, n = 0$ or $m = 0, n = 1$. Then the knight can reach there in 3 moves(You need to show the reason briefly).\\
	Suppose the knight can reach everywhere in finite sequene of moves when the size is $s$. Consider $s + 1$ size. It contains $s$-size board where knight can reach everywhere. So the knight can reach the expanded line in only one move at a distance of $2\times1$ or $1\times2$ from there.\\
