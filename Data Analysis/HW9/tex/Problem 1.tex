\section*{Problem 1}
	\begin{proof} [Solution]
		We would like to explain the distribution of fine dust using the 2DCA model. We define environmental influences such as wind and factories as random variables, and model how they participate in the spread of fine dust through programming. Wind moves dust in a given direction, and factories periodically emit dust from fixed locations. We can provide dust data at a specific point in time as initial input and then experiment to see if it shows the expected results over time. However, due to very limited variables, data, time, and insufficient skills, the results were significantly different from reality. We should have looked at the data first and planned the direction of the experiment.\\
