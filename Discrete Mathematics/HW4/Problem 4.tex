\section*{Problem 4}
	\begin{proof} [Solution]
		There is no optimal algorithm to find the secret key! This is known as \textit{Diffie-Hellman problem}. An efficient way for solving this problem is not yet known(intuitively, if such algorithm exists, then it is not a part of cryptology). Therefore, you should try all $k_1, k_2 \in \mathbb{N}$(This is called \textit{Brute-force algorithm}). If we start from 1 and calculate directly, then $k_1 = 10$ and $k_2 = 21$, so $s = 3^{210}\mod 31 = 1$.\\
