\section*{Problem 5}
\begin{proof}
	Proof by induction. Let $k$ be a number of players. Consider $k = 1$. Then it is obvious, because that person is the only person, survivor.\\
	Suppose it is true for $k = 2n - 1$ players. Consider $k = 2n + 1$ players. Choose two people who have the minimum distance. Then they are eliminated by each other. Since there remains $2n - 1$ players, by induction, The argument is true.\\
