\section{Introduction}
    This project seeks to simulate the dynamics of fine particulate matter in the atmosphere using 2D cellular automata.
    \subsection{Purpose}
        The main objective of this study is to compare theoretical simulations of fine particulate matter dispersion with real-world observations. The simulations focus on the geographic distribution of factories, prevailing wind conditions, and initial concentrations of fine particulate matter. By comparing the simulation results with real-world environmental data, we hope to discover insights into the patterns and factors that influence the movement and generation of fine particulate matter.

        An important aspect of the analysis is the evaluation of discrepancies between simulation results and real-time data, which can highlight the existence and importance of factors in addition to those incorporated in the model that influence the behavior of particulate matter under real-world conditions. Recognizing these factors is critical to developing a more comprehensive understanding of particulate matter dynamics.
