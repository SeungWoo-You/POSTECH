\section*{Problem 2}
	\begin{proof}
		By the definition of \textit{full m-ary tree}, $m$ should satisfy $m \mid (84 - 1) = m \mid 83$, because all nodes except the root node are grouped into chunks size of $m$. Since 83 is a prime, $m = 1$ or 83. If $m = 1$, then the height is 83. If $m = 83$, then the height is 1. Both cases are not suitable.\\
