	\centering The Black-Scholes model calculates the price of a an option in the stock market. It can be solved with hands, but also by computing. In this article, the main concern is to find better numerical ways of the model. Analytic solution and some problem solving techniques are introduced. Since the model is PDE contains $s$ and $t$ coordinates, changing to ODE is essential to get the numerical solution. Different method was used to obtain the $s$-coordinate value. Finially, find the absolute error and compare them at each time. Global error also analyzed.\\
